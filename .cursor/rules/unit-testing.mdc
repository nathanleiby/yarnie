For All Unit Tests:

- Use Jest for unit testing
- Only create mock variables you will use
- Properly type all test data
- Use BDD style language in describe and it blocks
- Handle edge cases
- Unit tests for every public function.
- Test doubles for dependencies, except inexpensive third-party calls.

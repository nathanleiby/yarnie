# Story 1: Project List View

## Story

**As a** knitter/crocheter\
**I want** to see a list of my yarn projects\
**so that** I can easily manage and track multiple ongoing projects.

## Status

Complete

## Context

Knitters and crocheters often work on multiple projects simultaneously and need a way to keep track of them. The Project List View is the main entry point of the application, providing users with an overview of all their projects. This feature allows users to create new projects, see their progress status, and organize them by pinning important ones to the top.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1 (approximately 10 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] Display an empty state with "No projects yet" message when no projects exist
2. - [x] Show a list of projects with their names and status
3. - [x] Allow creating new projects with a name (required field)
4. - [x] Sort projects by recency (most recently updated first)
5. - [x] Allow pinning projects to the top of the list
6. - [x] Display project status (in progress/finished)
7. - [x] Implement a clean, responsive mobile-first design

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Set up initial project structure
   1. - [x] Create ProjectList component
   2. - [x] Define Project interface and props
   3. - [x] Set up testing environment
2. - [x] Implement core functionality
   1. - [x] Create empty state view
   2. - [x] Implement project list display
   3. - [x] Add project sorting logic
   4. - [x] Add pin functionality
   5. - [x] Add status display
3. - [x] Implement project creation
   1. - [x] Add "New Project" button
   2. - [x] Create project creation form
   3. - [x] Handle project creation
4. - [x] Testing and Documentation
   1. - [x] Write unit tests for all functionality
   2. - [x] Add comments and documentation
   3. - [-] Manual testing on mobile device (will be done in integration phase)

## Constraints

- Must work offline
- Must be responsive for mobile devices
- Must handle large lists efficiently
- Must preserve project order after app restart

## Dev Notes

- Using React Native for cross-platform compatibility
- Implemented with TypeScript for better type safety
- Using Jest and React Native Testing Library for tests
- Following mobile-first design principles

## Progress Notes As Needed

- Initial component and tests created
- Basic functionality implemented
- Component documentation added
- All unit tests passing
- Manual testing deferred to integration phase when we have the full app running

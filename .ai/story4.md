# Story 4: Web Deployment

## Story

**As a** knitter/crocheter\
**I want** to access my stitch counter from any device with a web browser\
**so that** I can track my projects even when I don't have my phone.

## Status

In Progress

## Context

While Yarnie is primarily a mobile app, having web access provides flexibility for users who prefer using their computers or tablets. The web version should maintain the same core functionality as the mobile app, with data persisting across browser sessions using local storage. This ensures users can seamlessly switch between devices while maintaining their project data.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2 (approximately 20 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [ ] Deploy application to GitHub Pages
2. - [ ] Ensure all core functionality works in web browsers
   - Project list view
   - Project creation
   - Row counting
   - Project status updates
3. - [ ] Implement browser local storage for project data persistence
4. - [ ] Maintain responsive design that works well on desktop and tablet screens
5. - [ ] Ensure touch interactions work properly on touch-enabled devices
6. - [ ] Verify that the web app works offline (PWA functionality)

## Subtasks

1. - [ ] Setup Web Build
   1. - [ ] Configure Expo for web build
   2. - [ ] Setup GitHub Actions for automated deployment
   3. - [ ] Configure custom domain (if needed)
2. - [ ] Web Adaptation
   1. - [ ] Adapt mobile navigation for web
   2. - [ ] Optimize layout for larger screens
   3. - [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
3. - [ ] Data Persistence
   1. - [ ] Implement browser local storage
   2. - [ ] Add data migration handling
   3. - [ ] Add storage error handling
4. - [ ] Testing
   1. - [ ] Test on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   2. - [ ] Test responsive layouts
   3. - [ ] Test offline functionality

## Constraints

- Must work offline
- Must maintain data persistence across browser sessions
- Must be responsive for all screen sizes
- Must maintain feature parity with mobile app
- Must work on modern browsers (last 2 versions)

## Dev Notes

- Using Expo's web build capabilities
- Using browser's local storage for data persistence
- Following responsive design best practices
- Implementing PWA features for offline support
